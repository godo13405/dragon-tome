This is a hook for a chatbot built on Dialogflow that looks up information about D&D 5e.

## Functionality
You can ask it about a lot of things. It even understands the context from one question to the next. So if you ask it **what is Fireball** and then **what damage does it do** it will tell you what damage Fireball does.

Here are some samples of what you can ask and the responses you should get. Bear in mind these are just examples, as some of the phrases are randomised.
